# VLM-Based Industrial Safety Monitoring Pipeline

[![Notion Dashboard](https://img.shields.io/badge/Notion-Dashboard-black?logo=notion)](https://fuzzy-wildebeest-406.notion.site/VLM-Safety-Monitor-38d73d4932e0807e9e35df13c2611834?source=copy_link)

> A three-stage AI pipeline (Detection → VLM → LLM) for automated industrial safety monitoring, inspired by real-world solutions in the computer vision AI industry.

---

## Overview

This project implements an end-to-end pipeline that analyzes workplace images to detect PPE (Personal Protective Equipment) violations and automatically generates safety inspection reports.

The pipeline is designed to mirror real-world industrial safety AI systems, with each stage clearly separated by responsibility:

| Stage | Model | Role |
|---|---|---|
| Detection | YOLO (pretrained) | Detect workers and PPE items |
| Understanding | VLM API | Interpret the scene contextually |
| Reporting | LLM API | Generate structured safety reports |
| Storage | Notion API | Auto-save reports to Notion DB |

---

## Pipeline Architecture

The system operates in a hybrid, resource-optimized 6-step process:

**1. Image Upload & Async Execution (Detection Model)**
- User uploads an image to the FastAPI backend.
- The local object detection model runs inference. If a potential anomaly or PPE violation is suspected (e.g., a person detected without a helmet or vest, or with ambiguous safety gear status), the system triggers the heavier VLM/LLM cloud pipeline asynchronously to keep the API responsive.

**2. Metadata Extraction (Detection Model)**
- The detection model detects workers and PPE items, outputting bounding boxes, classes, and confidence scores.
- Rather than cropping the image (which destroys surrounding context), it generates a structured text summary of the detections (e.g., `Worker 1 (helmet: ✗, vest: ✓), Worker 2 (helmet: ✓, vest: ✓)`).

**3. VLM Contextual Analysis (Method 2)**
- Send the **original image** and the **detection model-extracted text metadata** together to the Vision-Language Model (VLM).
- VLM interprets the full scene contextually (e.g., "Worker 1 is standing close to a heavy machinery danger zone without a helmet") while avoiding small-object detection hallucinations by relying on the detection model's pre-filter.

**4. LLM Report Generation & Structured Outputs**
- Receive VLM scene description as input.
- Classify violation types (Missing PPE / Danger zone access / Abnormal behavior) and determine severity (High / Medium / Low).
- Enforce strict JSON output format using **Pydantic schemas** (Structured Outputs) to guarantee schema compliance.
- Generate actionable recommendations based on standard operating procedures (SOP).

**5. Result Storage**
- Save complete pipeline output as a JSON file (detection results + VLM output + LLM report).
- Automatically log results to the connected Notion Database using structural mapping.

**6. HTML Result Dashboard**
- Display the uploaded image with drawn bounding boxes.
- Display the VLM situation description.
- Display the final structured LLM report (Violations / Severity / Actions).

## Output Example

### Detection Result
```
[Worker 1] helmet: ✗  vest: ✓  gloves: ✗
[Worker 2] helmet: ✓  vest: ✓  gloves: ✓
[Worker 3] helmet: ✗  vest: ✗  gloves: ✗
```

### VLM Scene Description
```
Three workers detected in an industrial zone. 
Worker 1 and Worker 3 are not wearing helmets. 
Worker 3 is also missing a safety vest and approaching a restricted area.
```

### LLM Safety Report
```
[Safety Inspection Report]
- Date: 2026-06-29
- Violations Detected: 3
  · PPE Missing (Helmet): Worker 1, Worker 3
  · PPE Missing (Vest): Worker 3
  · Restricted Area Access: Worker 3
- Severity: HIGH
- Recommended Action:
  · Immediately halt Worker 3's activity
  · Issue PPE to Worker 1 and Worker 3 before resuming work
  · Reference: SOP Section 3.2 - Mandatory PPE Requirements
```

## Notion Integration

Each pipeline run automatically creates a new page in the connected Notion database, containing:

- Input image
- Detection summary
- VLM scene description
- Full LLM safety report
- Severity level & timestamp

## Design Decisions

**Why separate Detection and VLM?**
YOLO provides fast, precise bounding boxes but lacks contextual understanding. VLM adds scene-level reasoning on top of detection results, enabling nuanced descriptions that rule-based systems cannot produce.

**Why separate VLM and LLM?**
Raw VLM output is descriptive but unstructured. A dedicated LLM step refines this into a structured report with violation classification, severity scoring, and actionable recommendations aligned with SOP guidelines.

**Why Notion over a database?**
For a portfolio-scale project, Notion provides an immediately accessible, visually rich storage layer without requiring infrastructure setup, while demonstrating API integration skills.
